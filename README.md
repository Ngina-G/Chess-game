## Description
For many beginners, chess seems overly complicated and unnecessarily difficult. Often  being passed over for other less mentally taxing taxing board games during game night. With each piece moving in its own unique way, chess can take time to learn and master. Our product gives people curious about chess, beginners and master who want to refresh their skills the opportunity to understand the way each piece moves. We offer a fun and interactive way to become a Grand-master with patience and practice.

### How To
Upon opening the page, the user is greeted with a brief introduction to Chess and using several buttons can navigate to the <strong>Play page</strong>. This is where the user will be introduced to the default and most important piece "the King". From here the user can navigate to different pieces where the layout is similar to that of the king.
<br>
There after in each 'piece play page' , the user can see how the pieces move and intereact with the board to see the valid chess moves for each piece.
<br> 
If the user is facing any challenges, they can contact us through the appropriate buttons or subscribe to the weekly newsletter.

<i>The contact and subscribe button are for display only as this is a demo site</i>
